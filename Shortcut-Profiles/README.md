# Shortcut Profiles
This folder contains .kys files for Adobe Premiere. 

The reason for this is that the Teensy keyboard library utilizes the keys for the US keyboard instead of 
ASCII. The issue also applies in Adobe Premiere where depending on the layout of the keyboard, the mappings 
are changed. In order to combat this, .kys files for each keyboard shortcut are created. The intention of 
these files is to not interfere with the default profile.

## Currently supported layouts
