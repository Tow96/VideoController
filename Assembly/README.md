# Assembly
This folder contains the files that make up the physical device. They are available in .SLDPRT and .STL 
formats.

The files are:

- Baseplate - The main body of the device, every component is mounted to this. It has holes to install 
M3x5x4 heat set inserts to it.

- Wheel - The knob for the main encoder, consists of two pieces to provide an accent to the build.

- Backplate - Plate to cover the electronics.

- Encoder Knob - Knurled knob by
